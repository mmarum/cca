<p>Wheel Wars is a fast and fun, head-to-head pottery wheel competition where eight to ten local DFW potters will compete in 3 round eliminations.  Each competitor will have to make the same specified forms on the pottery wheel under time constraints. Each pottery form that the competitors make for a given round will have specific and measurable minimum requirements. If all requirements are met from both potters in a bracket, in each heat, the shortest length of time used to make the form will be the deciding factor for the winner of that heat.  All competitors must have some experience making pottery on a pottery wheel. </p>

<p>This is a FREE community event and competitors are encouraged to bring friends and family to watch and cheer them on. </p>

<p>This year's judge is last year's winner, Sam Watson.</p>

<p>Potters are competing for a Wheel Wars 2025 Trophy.</p>
