<p>Wheel Wars is back! Wheel Wars 2 is a fast and fun, head-to-head pottery wheel competition where eight amateur potters will compete in 3 round eliminations.  Each competitor will have to make the same specified forms on the pottery wheel under time constraints. Each pottery form that the competitors make for a given round will have specific and measurable minimum requirements. If all requirements are met from both potters in a bracket, in each heat, the shortest length of time used to make the form will be the deciding factor for the winner of that heat.  All competitors must be a beginner level potter but must have some experience making pottery on a pottery wheel. </p>

<p><a href="/registration/wheel-wars/">Registration forms for the Wheel Wars competition must be submitted to Catalyst Creative Arts by March 21, 2022.</a></p>

<p>This is a FREE event and competitors are allowed to bring friends and family to watch and cheer them on. Wheel Wars 2 will be live-streamed, recorded, and published on our social media sites. </p>
