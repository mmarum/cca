<p>Wheel Wars is back! Wheel Wars is a fast and fun, head-to-head pottery wheel competition where eight amateur potters will compete in 3 round eliminations.  Each competitor will have to make the same specified forms on the pottery wheel under time constraints. Each pottery form that the competitors make for a given round will have specific and measurable minimum requirements. If all requirements are met from both potters in a bracket, in each heat, the shortest length of time used to make the form will be the deciding factor for the winner of that heat.  All competitors must be amateur, beginner or hobby potters with some experience making pottery on a pottery wheel. No professionals please. </p>
